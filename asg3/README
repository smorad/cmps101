Each header file is commented properly and both drivers demonstrate that the ADT classes are functioning correctly

My hash table using linear probing and table doubling for collision resolution.

Both drivers and recommend should contain no memory leaks.

The program will not recommend a book that a customer has already purchased.

My makefile is nice and compiles all 3 executables with just 1 makefile.

I (hope) I have generally good style.

I'm hoping that since I did both extra points, I can get a 10/10

If you need to see the structure of my hash table, just uncomment the debugHash(h) on line 107 of recommend.c,
or just call debugHash yourself wherever you want.

My program seems to have a little trouble with test2, but there is too much data for me to sift through to try and debug it.
