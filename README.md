Advanced Algorithms and ADT's


asg1
------
A heavy duty doubly linked list ADT. All other assignments make use of this linked list implementation.

asg2
-----
Implementations of heapsort and insertion sort, and a speed comparison between the two.

asg3
------
An amazon-esque book recommendation system for customers. This uses lists, hashtables, and sorting algorithms to recommend books to one user
based on the books read by the current user and other users with similar tastes.

asg4
------
A graph ADT, where user input is read in and the shortest path algorithm is applied to find the quickest path to a given node.
